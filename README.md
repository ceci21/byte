## Requirements

- Node 0.10.x
- React
- bcrypt
- jquery
- mysql
- knex


## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
- Database credentials
- Session secret (can be any secure random string)
- API keys for Spoonacular and Yummly

For security:
- Never commit the `.env` file
- Never share API keys or credentials
- Rotate secrets if they are ever exposed

### Running webpack and server

```sh
npm run react-dev
npm run server-dev
```

### Recreating schema

To recreate schema that sets the database and its tables, run the following:

```sh
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
```

To make SQL queries within the database, run:
``` sh
mysql -u root -p
```

Password is specific to your machine for the "root" user
insert this password into database-mysql/knexSetup.js line 6
